    "text": "The School of Psychology encourages staff to preregister their research as standard. \n\n\nPreregistration involves publishing your plans in a protocol for research before you conduct the research. This preregistration should be version-controlled, time-stamped, and deposited in a publicly accessible repository. It ensures that any change to the research plans or protocol can be traced, which disincentivizes presenting a changed protocol as the original, intended protocol. The more detailed the preregistered protocol, the more preregistration prevents results being influenced – even inadvertently – by undisclosed flexibility in research practices, which is known to affect replicability. Most pre-registered information should include the following: \n\nA statement of the hypotheses/research questions being assessed \n\n\n\nA clear methodology which can be replicated by other researchers \n\n\n\nThe key variables that will be measured and/or theoretical lens by which information will be viewed \n\n\n\nAn indication of the intended sample size (ideally justified with a power analysis for quantitative research) and how this will be obtained (recruitment/retention plans) \n\n\n\nA detailed description of the analysis that will be conducted \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore robust and transparent research: increased trustworthiness and confidence in replicability  \nClarity on dissociation between confirmatory and exploratory analyses   \nClarity on plan for research team – a document to guide data analyses  \n\n\n\nAvoiding any suggestion of benefiting from undisclosed flexibility  \nAvailable as article type (Registered Reports), ensuring publication of confirmatory science irrespective of results  \nResearchers are being criticized for P-hacking (reporting only significant findings) and HARKing (hypothesising after the results are known) within scientific research; through preregistration we can illustrate that we do not engage in these practices \n\n\n\n\nAll types of research can be pre-registered. Preregistration can be used for both confirmatory and exploratory research, in any research approach – quantitative and qualitative. Besides quantitative experimental designs, this includes among others observational designs, survey designs, randomized trials, secondary data analyses, qualitative interviews, ethnographies or focus groups, and systematic reviews. The key here is that the preregistration provides transparency about what the research plan was prior to data collection. For some designs such as ethnography or qualitative interviews, minimal information may be known in advance; for others such as randomised trials, much more information will be known and available for preregistration. \n\n\n\nHow and where to register your protocols depends on the purpose and the type of research you are conducting. Several online repositories have been created that are optimized for the practice of preregistration and transparency (e.g., version control, links to data). These are given below. \nThere may be different requirements for each type of research and the Equator Network have provided guidance on what to include in protocols for a selection of different designs. To date, this includes trials, intervention detail, systematic reviews, tomography studies, intervention development studies, and core outcome sets. You can also publish the protocol as a peer-reviewed journal article, but this should be considered in addition to the registrations below given the time the peer-review process takes. If your chosen journal facilitates this (see Sherpa Romeo you could deposit the pre-print (i.e., the manuscript submitted for publication) at a pre-print server such as PsyArXiv. \n\n\n\nBelow, we list the main repositories to help staff get started with preregistration on these portals. \nhttps://AsPredicted.org \n\nMainly for quantitative research \nAnswer 10 questions about research protocol\nAnswers saved as pdf website \nExample: Valkanidis, Doumas, and Dessing (2020) \nResearchers control the visibility (private or public). \n\nOpen Science Framework | OSF Preregistration \n\nPlatform dedicated to Open Science.\n\n\n\nVariety of formats for specific types of research (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, systematic reviews, scoping reviews, secondary data analyses) \nCan be helpful for student preregistrations (supervisors are encouraged to create a single page for a given academic year cohort e.g., 2022/2023, with folders for each registered project) \nExamples: Reid and Dessing (2016), Schultze, Gerlach and Rittich ( 2017)\n\nClinicalTrials.gov \n\nPreregistration of clinical trials \nIt is an ethical requirement as per the Declaration of Helsinki that every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first participant. A list of other registration sites are: Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved registry. Please note that some of these may incur a charge. For trials you should also complete a SPIRIT protocol document for your Trial Master file. \n\nPROSPERO (york.ac.uk) \n\nPreregistration of systematic reviews \n\n\n\nIf you are aiming to publish your systematic review, you may severely limit your publication chances if you do not preregister your review. Good guidance on systematic review conduct can be found on York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. To minimize work for the team at PROSPERO, only those reviews you intend to publish should be hosted at this site. For reviews in the context of teaching the Open Science Framework is more appropriate, but the preregistration could follow the structure of the PROSPERO registration.  \n\nCOMET Initiative \n\nFor core outcome sets or minimum data standards \n\nPlease consider depositing your preregistration on the PURE platform after you have registered it on one of the platforms above. To do so, log into your PURE account, go to research outputs, other contribution, protocol, and select either peer-reviewed (e.g., Prospero) or non-peer-reviewed (e.g., OSF) and link to the DOI. You might also want to highlight this as a protocol in the title of the deposit to minimise confusion if you use the same title for the paper arising from the work. \n\n\n\nThis is a form of preregistration, where a paper is accepted by journals at the protocol stage, prior to data collection. The protocol goes through the peer review process where the introduction, hypotheses, methods and analysis plan are scrutinized before data is collected. This is used for both quantitative and qualitative studies. If accepted, the journal commits to publishing the full report irrespective of the results, as long as the preregistered protocol is followed and the conclusions are justified by the data. \nOnce data is collected and analyzed the registered report is updated with the findings and write up and is resubmitted to the same journal for further peer review.  You can read more about registered reports here. The site linked also contains a list of journals already offering the registered reports format. Note, however, that this approach may have implications which compete with time demands of external funders or student supervision. \n\n\n\nDoesn’t preregistration stifle exploration and creativity? \nNo. Nothing prevents further exploration of the patterns within a dataset. Preregistration just ensures that such analyses are appropriately identified as exploratory. Plans can also change, and this can be reflected in an updated version of the preregistered protocol prior to research start, or if research has already started, then transparently reported and explained as a deviation from the protocol in the write up. \nIs it extra work? \nYes and no. Yes, preregistration typically involves an in-depth research protocol, the details of which may take more time to iron out. However, since most research within Psychology requires an ethics application, which also involves a research protocol, at least part of the information is already written down even without preregistration. Moreover, preregistration changes the order in which researchers spend time: putting in more effort before data collection reduces the time needed from data collection to dissemination. \nIf I preregister elsewhere why do I need to add it to my PURE repository? \nAny preregistration on any site/portal implies that you are doing the work; it creates an easily searchable protocol, which individuals who are considering similar work can see to avoid duplication of effort (e.g., in reviews), or to guide replication efforts (e.g., replication studies). \nIt is useful to deposit your published preregistration on PURE as it can link to the final publication when it has been published; this demonstrates your (and your co-authors’) commitment to open science, and institutional commitment to open science which grows our research reputation."

    "text": "These guidelines will support staff of the School of Psychology, Queen’s University Belfast, in their efforts to engage in Open Science practices, now considered to be at the cutting edge of our discipline. We aim to inspire staff to engage with Open Science; we should all aspire to adopt Open Science practices. Over time, this may well become requirements (e.g., from publishers, funders, REF), but it makes sense to anticipate this. These guidelines and Open Science in general are governed by several principles. \n\n\nThese Open Science guidelines are written as an accessible guide to Open Science for academic and research staff in the School of Psychology. However, they should also be helpful for professional service staff and students. In the spirit of Open Science, the guidelines are available for all including those from outside the institution. The following guide is a living document, which will be continually updated to keep the information aligned with advances in Open Science, so it is best to refer to the most current version of the guidelines. \n\n\n\nOpen Science emphasises transparency and integrity in accurate and truthful reporting of science. Being open and transparent at all stages and all levels of the scientific process improves all scientific fields. The principles and proposed practices of Open Science serve to expand the accessibility and inclusivity of research and the knowledge it creates. By making data, analysis methods, and other research materials available to all through online repositories, many of the barriers to participation in science for those outside of elite academic institutions are removed. In this sense, Open Science principles are aligned to enhancing equity in science and expanding the diversity of future research as a result. \n\n\n\nOpen Science directly addresses the ‘replication crisis’ initially identified in the field of Psychology. The replication crisis happened because scientists  were incentivised (by the academic reward structure) to report results that often failed to replicate (e.g., ‘false positives’). Open Science is a mindset to do what is right for science, to strive for  \n- transparency of motivations, methods and inferences  \n- reproducibility of scientific methods  \n- robustness of patterns (i.e., replicability) \nOpen Science emphasises transparency and integrity in accurate and truthful reporting of science. Being open and transparent at all stages and all levels of the scientific process improves all scientific fields.  \nThere is an increasing recognition of the value of Open Science practices proposed to fulfil these aims. Indeed, engagement with Open Science is being embedded in criteria for 1) open access publishing in high impact journals, 2) research funding, especially by national and international funders 3) the Research Excellent Framework, 4) academic job descriptions and progression and 5) Higher Education teaching curricula. \n\n\n\nTo help embed Open Science within the research culture of the School of Psychology, this guide will provide descriptions and practical advice on key Open Science practices: Preregistration, Ethics and Open Science, Open data, ([Open materials])https://qubpsy.github.io/QUBPsyOpenScience/open_materials.html), Open-source formats, Reproducible Documents, Open-Access Publishing and Education. \n\n\n\nThis document is written by your colleagues to support the School’s efforts to be more engaged in open science practices. If you spot any errors, would like to add any amendments, or have an innovation or efficient practice to share, please fill out the Open Science Webform.\nIf you require any advice or support regarding your Open Science practice feel free to contact the authors at \nJoost Dessing j.dessing@qub.ac.uk \nLisa Graham-Wisener l.grahamwisener@qub.ac.uk  \nGary McKeown g.mckeown@qub.ac.uk  \nPaul Toner p.toner@qub.ac.uk  \nMatthew Rodger m.rodger@qub.ac.uk \nGillian Shorter g.shorter@qub.ac.uk \nTanja Gerlach t.gerlach@qub.ac.uk \nThomas Schultze-Gerlach t.schultze@qub.ac.uk"

Just like Open Data, the sharing of materials greatly promotes reproducibility. Moreover, Open Materials increases efficiency in science, since it allows researchers to benefit from efforts of others.

    "text": "The QAA Subject Benchmark Statement for Psychology emphasises the importance of our students developing ‘psychological literacy’ (QAA, 2019). According to the QAA Statement, psychological literacy includes an awareness of current debates and controversies in the discipline, appreciation of ‘rigorous empirical methodology’, critical analysis, and understanding of the relationships between theory and evidence. Given the accelerated discussions within our field about the standards of evidence, the reliability of theoretically consequential findings, and the move towards more Open Science practices that are motivated by these discussions, it is clear that in the present day psychological literacy should include knowledge about Open Science. It is important therefore that students on our undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes are afforded opportunities to learn about and enact Open Science principles as part of their psychology training. \nThere are already several points in our degree programmes in which the context and/or the principles of Open Science feature as part of students’ education opportunities. These are described below for your awareness of what students on different programmes will be exposed to through their pathways. There are also further steps proposed in these guidelines to increase and enhance the Open Science content of our education delivery. Resources for including Open Science practices in student research projects is detailed elsewhere in these guidelines.

    "text": "The School of Psychology encourages staff to publish open-access where possible and appropriate to do so \n\n\nOpen access (OA) publishing refers to making research publications freely available to anyone who would want to access them, including the public. Traditionally, access to publications has been hidden behind a publisher paywall, meaning access is limited to those with a library subscription or those who can afford the access fee. By publishing open access, any financial, legal and technical barriers to accessing a publication are removed. There are different levels of open access publishing. Green open access refers to publishing in a traditional journal and sharing a version of the article (generally a preprint or postprint) in a subject or institutional repository. This often happens after an embargo period. Gold open access refers to publishing in an open access or hybrid journal, where a published version of the article is available directly from the publisher. This can happen immediately. \n\n\n\n\nMaximising the international visibility and reach of research, across both High-Income and Low-to-Middle-Income countries    \nMaximising the usefulness and impact of research to influence policy and practice   \nMaximising the value of publicly funded research to the taxpayer \n\n\n\n\n The Open Research team are available to advise on all aspects of open access publishing (https://libguides.qub.ac.uk/openaccess/introduction) and have several open access agreements with publishers, i.e. a fee waiver for Gold open access publishing.  \nIf you are not publishing in a Gold open access journal, QUB encourages researchers to share their publications at the earliest opportunity following publication. The nature of what is deposited will depend on the publisher and the Sherpa Romeo link below will support what you need to make available.  \nCORE \n\nThe largest aggregator of open access research papers in the world \n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) \n\nA directory of Open Access Journals  \n\nPsyArxiv \n\n A free preprint service for the psychological sciences \n\nSherpa Romeo \nAn online resource that provides summaries of publisher copyright and open access archiving policies on a journal-by-journal basis. It will also provide information on whether your journal supports pre-prints and what version of the manuscript is supported for PURE deposits. \n\n\n\nShould all publications be open access? \nIncreasingly, research funders (e.g., UKRI) are requiring publications to be open access and articles are also required to be open access for REF eligibility. If deciding not to publish open access, it is worth taking this into consideration. Ultimately it is important that your work appears before the most appropriate audience. \nIs it extra work? \nYes and no. The decision to publish open access can be incorporated into your decision-making process on where to publish. If publishing Green open access, there is a small amount of work involved in uploading the appropriate document version to a repository.  If you are unsure of where to publish it might be useful to use the a search engine such as Jane to narrow the field and/or seek advice."

    "text": "Much of science relies on computers and software. Many of the traditionally used software is commercial and thus requires a license. The cost for such licenses is a barrier to opening science, since not all institutes or labs will be able to afford the same licenses. This means some researchers might not be able to verify the conclusions of others, or benefit from their shared materials. The use of Open-Source formats aims to prevent this and contribute to data being interoperable (see Open Data). This involves ensuring data is shared in formats accessible by Open-source software, which can of course be achieved by using Open-source software as much possible throughout the research process.\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing reproducibility\nMaximizing usefulness of materials contributing to science and its progress\n\n\n\n\nThis is largely based on personal initiative. Search for Open Source variants of software you are using and decide whether and how these could replace your current proprietary software. Sometimes, a full switch to using a new software is the best solution; the School is currently starting the process of switching from using SPSS to using R-based software for statistical analyses. I some cases, sharing data or materials from proprietary software in formats that can be read by or executed by (e.g., computer code) by Open Source variants is the easiest solution. Of course, FAIR principles dictate that you must check this (this would also require you to report the software version for which you confirmed this)."

    "text": "What are Open-Source formats?\nMuch of science relies on computers and software. Many of the traditionally used software is commercial and thus requires a license. The cost for such licenses is a barrier to opening science, since not all institutes or labs will be able to afford the same licenses. This means some researchers might not be able to verify the conclusions of others, or benefit from their shared materials. The use of Open-Source formats aims to prevent this and contribute to data being interoperable (see Open Data). This involves ensuring data is shared in formats accessible by Open-source software, which can of course be achieved by using Open-source software as much possible throughout the research process."

    "text": "How to engage?\nThis is largely based on personal initiative. Search for Open Source variants of software you are using and decide whether and how these could replace your current proprietary software. Sometimes, a full switch to using a new software is the best solution; the School is currently starting the process of switching from using SPSS to using R-based software for statistical analyses. In some cases, sharing data or materials from proprietary software in formats that can be read by or executed by (e.g., computer code) by Open Source variants is the easiest solution. Of course, in line with FAIR principles you ideally confirm that the Open Source software indeed works for your materials. In this light, it is appropriate to report the software version for which you confirmed this. Indeed, citing the software and packages you used is important, both from a reproducibility perspective but also as way to acknowledge the work and time that people spent creating tools for others. Ideally, you would also include version numbers. Please see below for an example:\nAll statistical analyses were run using R 3.3.2 (https://www.r-project.org; R Core Team, 2016). In addition to the base version of R, we used the packages dplyr 0.5.0 (Wickham, 2011), effsize 0.7.0 (Torchiano, 2016), ggplot2 2.2.0 (Wickham, 2009), Hmisc 4.0–1 (Harrell, 2016), lm.beta 1.5–1 (Behrendt, 2014), multicon 1.6 (Sherman, 2015), psych 1.6.9 (Revelle, 2016), and yarrr 0.1.2 (Phillips, 2016) in our analyses."
