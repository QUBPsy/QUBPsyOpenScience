    "text": "Traditional workflows within science use many different kinds of tools. This requires careful recording of what happens at each step of the scientific process. Good laboratory notebook practices are a feature of many sciences but are not typically taught as part of a psychology curriculum. This combination within psychology of a lack of clear recording of data collection and analysis practices can lead to difficulties in retracing the steps that led to any given outcome in science. A traditional workflow in psychology may involve the design of research and preparation for ethical review using a word processor and perhaps some diagramming tools. This is followed by data collection on a different platform perhaps using pen and paper in a laboratory, but increasingly using automated platforms such as Qualtrics, PsychoPy, or jsPsych. Following this data is manipulated from the shape it comes from the platform and is wrangled into the right shape for analysis sometimes in a statistical program, but often using cut and paste techniques in Microsoft Excel or a similar spreadsheet program. The data is then analysed using some statistical software platform such SPSS, SAS, JASP, Jamovi or R. When the results are found these are extracted and the whole sequence is written up using some combination of a word processor—typically Microsoft Word—and perhaps some citation software such as Endnote or RefWorks.\nThe problem with this approach is that it is not very reproducible, the steps are difficult to trace unless the researcher is inordinately meticulous with their recording and it is prone to untraceable errors.\nThe solution is to create a reproducible document.\n\n\n\nReproducible documents are a way of eliminating as many of these disparate steps as possible and maximising the recording of the steps that are taken along the research process. The goal is to streamline the research process while making it more transparent and reproducible. Ideally these documents will be made available for the scrutiny of other scientific researchers and the public, but there are many advantages to using reproducible documents as they make the process of conducting science more efficient and they make research much easier to pick up after the inevitable six month to year hiatuses that occur throughout the scientific process as projects go through their different stages and the myriad competing attention drawing factors of a professional researchers life fragment our time.\nWe are not yet at a stage where all of the various platforms and processes can be accumulated into one work flow but we can do much better than the traditional approach.\nTypically a reproducible document is a combination of some word processing tools to create the document with mechanisms to insert computer code chunks that allow us to load, store, and manipulate data; conduct statistical and mathematical analysis; visualise the analysis producing tables and plots as part of the document output; and integrating with citation software to allow the easy creation of references.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a range of preexisting computational technologies that can be brought together to enable these documents. The TeX and LaTeX systems are well established document preparation and typesetting systems (latex-project), these are aided by the use of Markdown (markdownguide.org) which provides a very simple document markup language which the researcher uses to create the documents and pandoc (pandoc.org) which allows the same markdown document to be output to many different formats. One markdown document can be used to create websites, PDFs, Word documents, ePub books and many more. These represent the word processing part.\n\n\n\nThe computer chunks are comprised of various different languages that can be mixed and matched, the most commonly used languages are R and Python, but languages like Julia, Stan, Javascript, SQL, C, and Fortran.\nThe current document is being written as a reproducible document using the RStudio software and I can include a code chunk in R\n\ndata &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)\nx &lt;- mean(data)\nprint(x)\n\n[1] 5.5\n\n\nor in python\n\nimport statistics\ndata = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\nx = statistics.mean(data)\nprint(x)\n\n5.5\n\n\nCode chunks can be hidden and only the output produced which is useful when including any data wrangling code that you do not want to be seen in a finished output, of for creating tables and plots. The important thing is that the code remains visible in the source form of the document so it can be inspected if necessary and it stays in the one place with the end product document. You can see this process at work in Figure 1, which contains code included in the source document but hidden in the final document.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temperature and ozone level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation management and the automatic creation of a references section are important components of reproducible document systems. Most systems interact with pandoc, BibTeX, Zotero, Crossref, PubMed, and the DOI system to allow in text citations with automated References sections (e.g. McKeown, 2013). This reference will appear in the References section automatically without any more work.\n\n\n\nAn important but optional companion technology to the creation of reproducible documents is the variety of version control software such as git or svn. Git is the currently most popular type of version control. Version control systems were developed to keep track of the various changes that were made to computer code and to allow variations of code to be made and merged into a single document and to allow collaboration by multiple coders without the danger of overwriting each other. This turns out to be handy when it comes to writing documents too, especially documents that contain code. Think of version control as a high powered and rigorous combination of “track changes” and backing up files. It is a solution to folders full of final final final versions of the same document. Git is a piece of software that sits on your local computer and controls the versions of your documents, but it has a companion in github that offers remote hosting of documents and enables collaboration between multiple contributors. You can see the code for this document at (github.com/QUBPsy/QUBPsyOpenScience).\n\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of ways of creating reproducible documents. Here we will look at some of the options.\n\n\nOne of the two major pioneers of mechanisms to produce reproducible documents came from the combination of the R focused Integrated Development Environment (IDE) RStudio. RStudio started in 2011 to create an easy environment in which to write R code and install and manage R packages. In 2012 Yihui Xie introduced the knitr package to enable the creation of documents with code chunks embedded in them. Markdown become the most popular language to develop these documents and the rmarkdown package was introduced in 2014, and it became well embedded within the RSTudio IDE where a lot of effort was made to make the production of RMarkdown documents simple and easy. The kinds of documents that could be produced in RMarkdown, webpages and websites, pdf documents, Shiny web apps, journal articles, slides and presentations, and books.\nThe R Markdown ecosystem is now quite mature and there are many packages that allow people to get up and running with many different aspects such as: the creation of quite sophisticated websites using RStudio and Github pages (with many other options); the creation of APA style manuscripts and journal articles using papaja (although this remains somewhat buggy); templates to aid in the creation of many different kinds of journal articles through rticles such as Elsevier, IEEE, Royal Society, Springer, PNAS journal templates (Table 1 provides a full list of journal abbreviations); full book creation in online, pdf and ePub formats using bookdown (see an example here); various kinds of presentations (Powerpoint, Beamer, Slidy); dashboards using the flexdashboard package; and interactive documents incorporating Shiny web apps and html widgets.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The abbreviations for the R Markdown journal article templates avaialble in the rticles R package.\n\n\nacm\nfrontiers\noup_v0\n\n\nacs\nglossa\noup_v1\n\n\naea\nieee\npeerj\n\n\nagu\nims\npihph\n\n\najs\ninforms\nplos\n\n\namq\niop\npnas\n\n\nams\nisba\nrjournal\n\n\narxiv\njasa\nrsos\n\n\nasa\njedm\nrss\n\n\nbioinformatics\njoss\nsage\n\n\nbiometrics\njss\nsim\n\n\ncopernicus\nlipics\nspringer\n\n\nctex\nlncs\ntf\n\n\nelsevier\nmdpi\ntrb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne issue that arises with reproducible documents arises due to their instrinsic nature; they contain code. Code depends on other code and code changes with time. There are constant updates to packages and software and often these updates will break older code as functions become deprecated or change in nature. The solution to this problem is to create environments in which to encapsulate code and its dependencies. In R the Packrat and newer renv packages are designed to provide this dependency management within R. These packages will create a local environment snapshot of all the necessary code and allow them to reloaded whent he time comes to work with the files. An example of a reproducible document that uses renv to do this can be found at this github repository which provided the code to produce and run all the experiments need to produce this paper (Dupré et al., 2020).\n\n\n\nAnother option for creating reproducible documents that has its origins in the Python computer language ecosystem is Jupyter Notebooks. Typically these require knowledge of the Python programming language and comfort working in a command line environment such as terminals in Unix environments and Windows Terminal in Windows 10 and above (previously the Windows Console).\nA Jupyter Notebook is a reproducible document that normally sits in a folder on your computer and you interact with using an interface in your browser. You navigate to the appropriate folder in your terminal and type “jupyter notebook” and this opens your browser and browser window that allows you to interact with the document. Documents contain a mix of text and code. The is a classic Jupyter Notebook interface and a more advanced IDE style interface known as JupyterLab. There are online servers that will allow you to interact with Jupyter Notebooks without the need to install software and have a dedicated machine, some of these can be seen at the Jupyter project: classic interface, JupyterLab interface. Similarly to RStudio even though they started firmly focused on one language—Python—but they also realised the value in supporting multiple languages and allowing them to be used interchangeably, they now support about 40 languages including R (R in a Jupyter Notebook).\nDependency issues in Python can be dealt with in a similar way to R by creating environments in which the code and packages can be isolated from other environments. The use of virtual environments in Python is more well established than in R and there are a variety of ways to create them. For example, the venv module, the virtualenv package, or within the Anaconda Python distribution platform. Virtual environments are often advised as best practice within general Python usage.\n\n\n\nThe two previous reproducible document approaches showed a trend from focusing on a single language towards reproducible documents that are more flexible. Recently the people at RStudio have announced that they have taken this a step further with the development of Quarto, Quarto is a reproducible document system again built on Pandoc allowing documents to be created using Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks. Quarto is installed independently of the other systems as separate software on the computer and then each of the systems interface with it. Reproducible documents can then be created in a text editor, RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks or VS Code (Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code IDE). The goal is to make the document production part of the system agnostic to the way in which people prefer to work. As it is being spearheaded by RStudio it is likely to supersede the current R Markdown ecosystem (although R Markdown will be around for a long time). In producing Quarto the Rstudio team have taken the opportunity to make some of the issues that existed with R Markdown better and they seek to make a more unified system for developing each of the different styles of output. It is still in its infancy but I expect that it will quickly become the standard within the R ecosystem at least. This current book/website hybrid has been created using Quarto, although it’s very first incarnation was as a R Markdown Bookdown project.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s Visual Studio Code is an IDE that is used by many people who do development within the Windows ecosystem. With the arrival of Quarto it can now be used as an environment for developing reproducible documents. It requires the addition of a Code Extension. This may be useful if you are already a user of VS Code otherwise the Rstudio IDE is probably a better place to start."

    "text": "Ethics and Open Science \nIn order to engage with Open Science practices, you must consider some ethical issues that apply to your work. There are three key considerations: \n\nBeing clear with participants at the time of collection about what you plan to use the research data for \n\nMake sure that your participant information sheet and consent form inform participants that their anonymised data will be made available to the general public via the internet. Participants should consent to their anonymised data being freely shared. Not providing this information technically precludes the sharing of data files with others in any form. Therefore, language such as below should be included in the participant information sheet and consent form: \nInformation sheet\nBecause the data we collect from you may be of interest to other researchers, we will publish it on a publicly accessible online data repository. At that point, anyone will have access to your data. However, this only concerns fully anonymised information that cannot identify you, and we will only do this with your permission (please confirm this on the consent form). \nConsent form \nI understand that data from this study may be of interest to other researchers. I consent for my non-identifiable data to be shared through a publicly accessible online data repository. I know that even if I do not consent to this, I can still participate. \nIf the dataset contains any identifying information, you should also specify how participants can withdraw their consent for sharing this data at any time in the future: \nI know I can opt out of this at any time in the future by contacting xxxx, quoting my personal ID number. \n\nAnonymity of data and protecting the identity of your participants\n\nIf data cannot be anonymized and shared, a solution can be sharing metadata (a summary of the data, such as group means, standard deviations, effect sizes, a table with zero-order correlations between all study variables, etc.). Metadata should be richly described and contain accurate and relevant attributes. Clear indication of who generated the metadata should also be included. Signposting for data that is available by request only may also be appropriate.\nData can be anonymous – with no identifiers – or confidential – with some information that can identify individuals which should be kept according to data protection legislation. All data should be kept according to the permissions we have sought and been granted by the participants or data custodians. \nWhen data is confidential, such that it has some clearly identifiable information (e.g., addresses, names, postcodes, places, or other identifiers), much of this can be removed before data deposit or replaced with a unique identifier in the case of data that is linked over time. Where data requires anonymising before deposit, two individuals should independently inspect the dataset to remove any identifiable information or recode information in a standardised way as to minimise the risk of identification. Particular care should be given to the following: \n\nInformation including names, addresses, demographic information, place names, specific instances, dates of birth, etc.: remove or systematically recode. \nTextual information which may refer to or identify information or people: consider appropriate recoding which keeps meaning without identifying a person or situation. \nNumeric information which has a frequency of less than five which may identify an individual: consider collapsing categories down, depending on whether it is meaningful, or recode to a blank other. \n\nFor anonymous data that do not include any identifying information as standard, data should be checked for low frequency items which may need to be recoded as other or open questions should also be inspected for identifying information regarding self or others by one person before deposit.  \n\nRespecting the wishes of those who take part in research \n\nA commonly used phrasing is “Be as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Individuals should not be excluded from research participation if they would not like their information shared. \nFor a more extensive treatment of ethical considerations and practical tips regarding data sharing, see Meyer (2018). \n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMeyer, M. N. (2018). Practical tips for ethical data sharing. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 1(1), 131–144. https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747656"

    "text": "These guidelines will support staff of the School of Psychology, Queen’s University Belfast, in their efforts to engage in Open Science practices, now considered to be at the cutting edge of our discipline. We aim to inspire staff to engage with Open Science; we should all aspire to adopt Open Science practices. Over time, these may well become requirements (e.g., from publishers, funders, REF), but it makes sense to anticipate this. These guidelines and Open Science in general are governed by several principles. \n\n\nThese Open Science guidelines are written as an accessible guide to Open Science for academic and research staff in the School of Psychology. However, they should also be helpful for professional service staff and students. In the spirit of Open Science, the guidelines are available for all including those from outside the institution. The following guide is a living document, which will be continually updated to keep the information aligned with advances in Open Science, so it is best to refer to the most current version of the guidelines. \n\n\n\nOpen Science emphasises transparency and integrity in accurate and truthful reporting of science. Being open and transparent at all stages and all levels of the scientific process improves all scientific fields. The principles and proposed practices of Open Science serve to expand the accessibility and inclusivity of research and the knowledge it creates. By making data, analysis methods, and other research materials available to all through online repositories, many of the barriers to participation in science for those outside of elite academic institutions are removed. In this sense, Open Science principles are aligned to enhancing equity in science and expanding the diversity of future research as a result. \n\n\n\nOpen Science directly addresses the ‘replication crisis’ initially identified in the field of Psychology. The replication crisis happened because scientists  were incentivised (by the academic reward structure) to report results that often failed to replicate (e.g., ‘false positives’). Open Science is a mindset to do what is right for science, to strive for  \n- transparency of motivations, methods and inferences  \n- reproducibility of scientific methods  \n- robustness of patterns (i.e., replicability) \nOpen Science emphasises transparency and integrity in accurate and truthful reporting of science. Being open and transparent at all stages and all levels of the scientific process improves all scientific fields.  \nThere is an increasing recognition of the value of Open Science practices proposed to fulfil these aims. Indeed, engagement with Open Science is being embedded in criteria for 1) open access publishing in high impact journals, 2) research funding, especially by national and international funders 3) the Research Excellent Framework, 4) academic job descriptions and progression and 5) Higher Education teaching curricula. \n\n\n\nTo help embed Open Science within the research culture of the School of Psychology, this guide will provide descriptions and practical advice on key Open Science practices: Preregistration, Ethics and Open Science, Open data, Open materials, Open-source formats, Reproducible Documents, Open-Access Publishing and Education. \n\n\n\nThis document is written by your colleagues to support the School’s efforts to be more engaged in open science practices. If you spot any errors, would like to add any amendments, or have an innovation or efficient practice to share, please fill out the Open Science Webform.\nIf you require any advice or support regarding your Open Science practice feel free to contact the authors at \nJoost Dessing j.dessing@qub.ac.uk \nLisa Graham-Wisener l.grahamwisener@qub.ac.uk  \nGary McKeown g.mckeown@qub.ac.uk  \nPaul Toner p.toner@qub.ac.uk  \nMatthew Rodger m.rodger@qub.ac.uk \nGillian Shorter g.shorter@qub.ac.uk \nTanja Gerlach t.gerlach@qub.ac.uk \nThomas Schultze-Gerlach t.schultze@qub.ac.uk"

It was developed for work on the Linux opertaing system’s kernal. It is designed to be a distributed system allowing thousands of coders to hold code on different computers and allow them to be merged together to form a coherent code base for a product or system. There can be many parallel branches of the code. The fact that it was designed for thousands of coders to use at once and yet maintain a coherent and functioning codebase makes it a good system for scientific collaboration. It works on all of the major operating systems and there should be minimal problems there. As it has origins in Linux development it probably works more easily in UNIX-style evironments like Linux and MacOS, but, given the popularity of Windows, attention has paid to making it work seamlessly with Windows products. This does lead to the issue of instructions being a little differetn depending on the computer you are using. Git is open source software."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We encourage staff to preregister their research as standard. \n\n\nPreregistration involves publishing your plans in a protocol for research before you conduct the research. This preregistration should be version-controlled, time-stamped, and deposited in a publicly accessible repository. It ensures that any change to the research plans or protocol can be traced, which disincentivizes presenting a changed protocol as the original, intended protocol. The more detailed the preregistered protocol, the more preregistration prevents results being influenced – even inadvertently – by undisclosed flexibility in research practices, which is known to affect replicability. Most pre-registered information should include the following: \n\nA statement of the hypotheses/research questions being assessed \n\n\n\nA clear methodology which can be replicated by other researchers \n\n\n\nThe key variables that will be measured and/or theoretical lens by which information will be viewed \n\n\n\nAn indication of the intended sample size (ideally justified with a power analysis for quantitative research) and how this will be obtained (recruitment/retention plans) \n\n\n\nA detailed description of the analysis that will be conducted \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore robust and transparent research: increased trustworthiness and confidence in replicability  \nClarity on dissociation between confirmatory and exploratory analyses   \nClarity on plan for research team – a document to guide data analyses  \n\n\n\nAvoiding any suggestion of benefiting from undisclosed flexibility  \nAvailable as article type (Registered Reports), ensuring publication of confirmatory science irrespective of results  \nResearchers are being criticized for P-hacking (reporting only significant findings) and HARKing (hypothesising after the results are known) within scientific research; through preregistration we can illustrate that we do not engage in these practices \n\n\n\n\nAll types of research can be pre-registered. Preregistration can be used for both confirmatory and exploratory research, in any research approach – quantitative and qualitative. Besides quantitative experimental designs, this includes among others observational designs, survey designs, randomized trials, secondary data analyses, qualitative interviews, ethnographies or focus groups, and systematic reviews. The key here is that the preregistration provides transparency about what the research plan was prior to data collection. For some designs such as ethnography or qualitative interviews, minimal information may be known in advance; for others such as randomised trials, much more information will be known and available for preregistration. \n\n\n\nHow and where to register your protocols depends on the purpose and the type of research you are conducting. Several online repositories have been created that are optimized for the practice of preregistration and transparency (e.g., version control, links to data). These are given below. \nThere may be different requirements for each type of research and the Equator Network have provided guidance on what to include in protocols for a selection of different designs. To date, this includes trials, intervention detail, systematic reviews, tomography studies, intervention development studies, and core outcome sets. You can also publish the protocol as a peer-reviewed journal article, but this should be considered in addition to the registrations below given the time the peer-review process takes. If your chosen journal facilitates this (see Sherpa Romeo you could deposit the pre-print (i.e., the manuscript submitted for publication) at a pre-print server such as PsyArXiv. \n\n\n\nBelow, we list the main repositories to help staff get started with preregistration on these portals. \nhttps://AsPredicted.org \n\nMainly for quantitative research \nAnswer 10 questions about research protocol\nAnswers saved as pdf website \nExample: Valkanidis, Doumas, and Dessing (2020) \nResearchers control the visibility (private or public). \n\nOpen Science Framework | OSF Preregistration \n\nPlatform dedicated to Open Science.\n\n\n\nVariety of formats for specific types of research (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, systematic reviews, scoping reviews, secondary data analyses) \nCan be helpful for student preregistrations (supervisors are encouraged to create a single page for a given academic year cohort e.g., 2022/2023, with folders for each registered project) \nExamples: Reid and Dessing (2016), Schultze, Gerlach and Rittich ( 2017)\n\nClinicalTrials.gov \n\nPreregistration of clinical trials \nIt is an ethical requirement as per the Declaration of Helsinki that every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first participant. A list of other registration sites are: Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved registry. Please note that some of these may incur a charge. For trials you should also complete a SPIRIT protocol document for your Trial Master file. \n\nPROSPERO (york.ac.uk) \n\nPreregistration of systematic reviews \n\n\n\nIf you are aiming to publish your systematic review, you may severely limit your publication chances if you do not preregister your review. Good guidance on systematic review conduct can be found on York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. To minimize work for the team at PROSPERO, only those reviews you intend to publish should be hosted at this site. For reviews in the context of teaching the Open Science Framework is more appropriate, but the preregistration could follow the structure of the PROSPERO registration.  \n\nCOMET Initiative \n\nFor core outcome sets or minimum data standards \n\nPlease consider depositing your preregistration on the PURE platform after you have registered it on one of the platforms above. To do so, log into your PURE account, go to research outputs, other contribution, protocol, and select either peer-reviewed (e.g., Prospero) or non-peer-reviewed (e.g., OSF) and link to the DOI. You might also want to highlight this as a protocol in the title of the deposit to minimise confusion if you use the same title for the paper arising from the work. \n\n\n\nThis is a form of preregistration, where a paper is accepted by journals at the protocol stage, prior to data collection. The protocol goes through the peer review process where the introduction, hypotheses, methods and analysis plan are scrutinized before data is collected. This is used for both quantitative and qualitative studies. If accepted, the journal commits to publishing the full report irrespective of the results, as long as the preregistered protocol is followed and the conclusions are justified by the data. \nOnce data is collected and analyzed the registered report is updated with the findings and write up and is resubmitted to the same journal for further peer review.  You can read more about registered reports here. The site linked also contains a list of journals already offering the registered reports format. Note, however, that this approach may have implications which compete with time demands of external funders or student supervision. \n\n\n\nDoesn’t preregistration stifle exploration and creativity? \nNo. Nothing prevents further exploration of the patterns within a dataset. Preregistration just ensures that such analyses are appropriately identified as exploratory. Plans can also change, and this can be reflected in an updated version of the preregistered protocol prior to research start, or if research has already started, then transparently reported and explained as a deviation from the protocol in the write up. \nIs it extra work? \nYes and no. Yes, preregistration typically involves an in-depth research protocol, the details of which may take more time to iron out. However, since most research within Psychology requires an ethics application, which also involves a research protocol, at least part of the information is already written down even without preregistration. Moreover, preregistration changes the order in which researchers spend time: putting in more effort before data collection reduces the time needed from data collection to dissemination. \nIf I preregister elsewhere why do I need to add it to my PURE repository? \nAny preregistration on any site/portal implies that you are doing the work; it creates an easily searchable protocol, which individuals who are considering similar work can see to avoid duplication of effort (e.g., in reviews), or to guide replication efforts (e.g., replication studies). \nIt is useful to deposit your published preregistration on PURE as it can link to the final publication when it has been published; this demonstrates your (and your co-authors’) commitment to open science, and institutional commitment to open science which grows our research reputation."

    "text": "Doesn’t preregistration stifle exploration and creativity? \nNo. Nothing prevents further exploration of the patterns within a dataset. Preregistration just ensures that such analyses are appropriately identified as exploratory. Plans can also change, and this can be reflected in an updated version of the preregistered protocol prior to research start, or if research has already started, then transparently reported and explained as a deviation from the protocol in the write up. \nIs it extra work? \nYes and no. Yes, preregistration typically involves an in-depth research protocol, the details of which may take more time to iron out. However, since most research within Psychology requires an ethics application, which also involves a research protocol, at least part of the information is already written down even without preregistration. Moreover, preregistration changes the order in which researchers spend time: putting in more effort before data collection reduces the time needed from data collection to dissemination. \nIf I preregister elsewhere why do I need to add it to my PURE repository? \nAny preregistration on any site/portal implies that you are doing the work; it creates an easily searchable protocol, which individuals who are considering similar work can see to avoid duplication of effort (e.g., in reviews), or to guide replication efforts (e.g., replication studies). \nIt is useful to deposit your published preregistration on PURE as it can link to the final publication when it has been published; this demonstrates your (and your co-authors’) commitment to open science, and institutional commitment to open science which grows our research reputation."

    "text": "The QAA Subject Benchmark Statement for Psychology emphasises the importance of our students developing ‘psychological literacy’ (QAA, 2019). According to the QAA Statement, psychological literacy includes an awareness of current debates and controversies in the discipline, appreciation of ‘rigorous empirical methodology’, critical analysis, and understanding of the relationships between theory and evidence. Given the accelerated discussions within our field about the standards of evidence, the reliability of theoretically consequential findings, and the move towards more Open Science practices that are motivated by these discussions, it is clear that in the present day psychological literacy should include knowledge about Open Science. It is important therefore that students on our undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes are afforded opportunities to learn about and enact Open Science principles as part of their psychology training. \nThere are already several points in our degree programmes in which the context and/or the principles of Open Science feature as part of students’ education opportunities. These are described below for your awareness of what students on different programmes will be exposed to through their pathways. There are also further steps proposed in these guidelines to increase and enhance the Open Science content of our education delivery. Resources for including Open Science practices in student research projects is detailed elsewhere in these guidelines. Additional resources which have been designed for educational purposes can be found here. \n\n\n\n\nLevel 2 Core Psychology – the ‘replication crisis’ and open science measures in response are covered over three lecture hours as part of Conceptual Issues (typically part of assessment in exam questions) \nLevel 3 thesis – some supervisors encourage thesis students to pre-register projects and/or run replication studies \n\n\n\nCore Psychology – the ‘replication crisis’ and open science measures in response are covered over three lecture hours as part of Conceptual Issues (typically part of assessment in exam questions) \nThesis module– some supervisors encourage thesis students to pre-register projects and/or run replication studies \n\n\n\nResearch Skills – The principles, context and practices of Open Science are thoroughly covered throughout this module (100% assessment – pre-registration assignment) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2 Psychological Methods – encourage pre-registration and/or replication studies for Level 2 group research projects \nLevel 3 thesis – encourage pre-registration and/or (conceptual) replication studies and/or meta-analyses for thesis projects; thesis marking criteria to include considerations of how/whether thesis reports demonstrate open science principles in design and reporting of thesis (e.g., transparency of evidence, steps taken to avoid HARKing, actions taken to guard against QRPs). \n\n\n\nMethods, Design, and Analysis in Psychology – encourage pre-registration and/or replication studies for tutorial group projects \nThesis module – encourage pre-registration and/or (conceptual) replication studies and/or meta-analyses for thesis projects; thesis marking criteria to include considerations of how/whether thesis reports demonstrate open science principles in design and reporting of thesis (e.g., transparency of evidence, steps taken to avoid HARKing, actions taken to guard against QRPs) \n\n\n\nMaking project data openly available through a data repository (e.g., OSF) \nPre-registration of research protocols for projects (e.g., OSF, AsPredicted) \nShift to teaching analysis using openly accessible and reproducible data analysis software packages (R with R Markdown, Python with Jupyter, Quarto etc.)"

    "text": "Much of science relies on computers and software. Many of the traditionally used software is commercial and thus requires a license. The cost for such licenses is a barrier to opening science, since not all institutes or labs will be able to afford the same licenses. This means some researchers might not be able to verify the conclusions of others, or benefit from their shared materials. The use of Open-Source formats aims to prevent this and contribute to data being interoperable (see Open Data). This involves ensuring data is shared in formats accessible by Open-source software, which can of course be achieved by using Open-source software as much possible throughout the research process.\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing reproducibility\nMaximizing usefulness of materials contributing to science and its progress\n\n\n\n\nThis is largely based on personal initiative. Search for Open Source variants of software you are using and decide whether and how these could replace your current proprietary software. Sometimes, a full switch to using a new software is the best solution; the School is currently starting the process of switching from using SPSS to using R-based software for statistical analyses. In some cases, sharing data or materials from proprietary software in formats that can be read by or executed by (e.g., computer code) by Open Source variants is the easiest solution. Of course, in line with FAIR principles you ideally confirm that the Open Source software indeed works for your materials. In this light, it is appropriate to report the software version for which you confirmed this.\nIndeed, citing the software and packages you used is important, both from a reproducibility perspective but also as a way to acknowledge the work and time that people spent creating tools for others. Ideally, you would also include version numbers here. Please see below for an example:\nAll statistical analyses were run using R 3.3.2 (https://www.r-project.org; R Core Team, 2016). In addition to the base version of R, we used the packages dplyr 0.5.0 (Wickham, 2011), effsize 0.7.0 (Torchiano, 2016), ggplot2 2.2.0 (Wickham, 2009), Hmisc 4.0–1 (Harrell, 2016), lm.beta 1.5–1 (Behrendt, 2014), multicon 1.6 (Sherman, 2015), psych 1.6.9 (Revelle, 2016), and yarrr 0.1.2 (Phillips, 2016) in our analyses."
