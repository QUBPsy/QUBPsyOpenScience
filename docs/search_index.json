However, they should also be helpful for professional service staff and students. In the spirit of Open Science, the guidelines are available for all including those from outside the institution. The following guide is a living document which will be continually updated to keep the information aligned with advances in Open Science, so it is best to refer to the most current version of the guidelines. 2.2 Equity and Diversity Open Science emphasises transparency and integrity in accurate and truthful reporting of science. Being open and transparent at all stages and all levels of the scientific process improves all scientific fields. The principles and proposed practices of Open Science serve to expand the accessibility and inclusivity of research and the knowledge it creates. By making data, analysis methods, and other research materials available to all through online repositories, many of the barriers to participation in science for those outside of elite academic institutions are removed. In this sense, Open Science principles are aligned to enhancing equity in science and expanding the diversity of future research as a result. 2.3 Why is Open Science important? Open Science directly addresses the ‘replication crisis’ initially identified in the field of Psychology. This is where scientists were previously incentivised by the academic publishing system to report ‘false positive’ results which failed to replicate. In contrast, Open Science is a mindset to do what is right for science. There is increasing recognition of the value of Open Science practices which are being embedded within criteria, including but not limited to 1) open access publishing in high impact journals, 2) research funding, especially by national and international funders 3) the Research Excellent Framework, 4) academic job descriptions and progression 5) Higher Education teaching curricula. 2.4 Open Science Practices To help embed Open Science within the research culture of the School of Psychology, this guide will provide descriptions and practical advice on key Open Science practices.

Preregistration involves publishing detailed research protocol in version-controlled, time-stamped, openly accessible repositories prior to collecting any data. When preregistering a research protocol, researchers commit to a set of procedures in the public domain. For confirmatory research, these procedures should be appropriate for testing specific predictions of the study’s hypotheses. Time-stamped Open data will establish that data collection started after the research protocol was published, thus ensuring that any preregistered hypotheses and details of the data analyses cannot have been influenced by the data. Preregistration also reduces prevents undisclosed flexibility, which is known to affect replicability. 3.2 Benefits More robust and transparent research: increased confidence in replicability Clarity on dissociation between confirmatory and exploratory analyses Clarity on plan for research team – a document to refer back to during data analyses Avoiding any suggestion of benefiting from undisclosed flexibility Available as article type (Registered Reports), ensuring publication irrespective of results. 3.3 Questions Doesn’t preregistration stifle exploration and creativity? No. Nothing prevents further exploration of the patterns within a dataset. Preregistration just ensures that this exploration is adequate identified as follow-up analyses. 3.4 Is it extra work? Yes and no. Yes, preregistration typically involves a detailed research protocol, the details of which may take more time to iron out. However, since most research within Psychology requires an ethics application, which also involves a research protocol, so at least part of the information is already written down even within preregistration. Moreover, some time may be won back after data collection, especially because of the clarity of the plan. 3.5 Where to preregister? Several online repositories have been created that are optimized for the practice of preregistration (e.g., version control, links to data). These differ in terms of the format, which can also depend on the type of research. Below, we list the main repositories, followed by an instructional video to help staff get started with preregistration on these portals. This list will likely be extended as we move forward. 3.5.1 AsPredicted.org AsPredicted.org provides a straightforward solution for this, particularly for quantitative research. It requires researchers to answer 10 questions about their research protocol, after which a pdf containing all the answers is saved on the website; researchers can control the visibility of the protocol (private or public).

It is by far the most encompassing preregistration portal, allowing users to preregister their research protocol in a variety of formats, some of which are dedicated formats to specific types of research (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, systematic reviews, secondary data analyses).

Making the data that underlies the inferences and conclusions in our studies available to others is an important step to promoting replicability. It allows others to check these the validity of these inferences () or to search for further patterns within the data (maximizing the usefulness of the data). FAIR principles are considered important guidance for data availability, focusing on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse. 5.2 Benefits Maximizing usefulness of recorded data for public good In combination with preregistration it avoids suggestions of benefiting from undisclosed flexibility 5.3 Questions 5.3.1 Should all data be shared? No. A commonly used phrasing is “Be as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. If you cannot anonymize your data, sharing may not be needed or possible (unless explicitly consented by the participants). Moreover, sharing of data (or materials) may be constrained by considerations of intellectual property. 5.3.2 Is it extra work? Yes. Many of the repositories require creating an account. Moreover, while uploading data nowadays typically is a drag-and-drop exercise, FAIR principles mean the data should be organized logically and accompanied by metadata. However, with data accessibility in mind, many of these aspects can be introduced early in the research cycle to minimize the time needed. 5.3.3 Where to share data? QUB offers researchers to share their research data through Pure (https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/datasets/) Several online repositories are available for sharing data. 5.3.4 Research Box Mirroring AsPredicted.org Data and materials archive 5.3.5 Open Science Framework Platform dedicated to Open Science.
